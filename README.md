# Physics-305-Creative-Project
The topic of this project is star, galaxy, and quasar classification with machine learning. This project was completed as the final project for Physics 305.

## How to Use
This project has three folders, data, output, and src. The data folder holds the original csv of the data, star_classification.csv. It also contains the Python script getData.py that processes the original csv and creates a smaller csv with only the columns used, smaller_star_classification.csv, and the normalized data normalized_star_classification.csv. The src folder contains all of the code that creates the different models, one script per model, and the code used to conduct the initial analysis of the data, analyzeData.py. Finally, the output folder contains the graphs created in the data analysis portion of this project, images of the decision tree and on boosted decision tree created, and the summary statistics of the data set.
